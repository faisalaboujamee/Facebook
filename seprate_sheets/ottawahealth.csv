3715279245175334,2021-02-12 08:35:46,"THIS IS A CATCHY & ATTENTION-GRABBING TITLEToday the Province will likely announce what zone of the reopening framework we'll shift into as of Tuesday. Whatever is announced though doesn't change what we need to do. Why?Kindly read this very long post & we'll tell you.Fun fact: COVID-19 does not follow us on Facebook. COVID doesn't know or particularly care if we're in the Red or Orange zone.The behaviours of the virus do not depend on the current ‚Äòzone‚Äô of public health restrictions. And to be perfectly candid neither should ours.Once upon a time we used to say ""We Are In This Together"" in our messaging. Here's the thing: we are but we aren't. Not everyone is experiencing this pandemic the same.Nurses doctors paramedics & healthcare workers have experienced things much differently than most of us.Some people have been home & isolated for months while others haven't been able to stop working.Business owners & hospitality workers have been on a rollercoaster of openings & closures.Students parents teachers & school staff have had to adapt to going from online to in-person learning (and back again) numerous times.And this virus has disproportionately affected some groups more than others.But there's the thing: while our experiences of this pandemic haven't been shared we do have a shared goal.And we can reach it together.Want to ease the strain on our healthcare workers? We can avoid gatherings only socialize in-person w/those we live with & limit our non-essential outings.Want to help ensure that once our local businesses reopen they stay open? We can wear masks & physically distance.Keeping schools open & as safe as possible? We can monitor ourselves daily and we can get tested & isolate if we have COVID symptoms (got kids? Ditto).Helping those who are isolated or have been disproportionately affected? We must get our vaccine when our time comes.Speaking of segues the vaccine rollout plan (based on the current delivery schedule) will see the general population of Ottawa begin to get their vaccines in August.Between now and then we'll be following our COVID-19 Vaccination Plan: http://ow.ly/icfy30rwpgr.This means 2 things: there's light at the end of this dark tunnel & we must do everything we can to keep that light bright.No one is perfect. In fact other than the song Tiny Dancer perfection doesn't exist.Yes some of us haven't been 100% COVID-wise every single day of the pandemic.But the past is the past. This isn't a time for shaming it's a time to recognize that we need to focus on continuing to be better today and tomorrow and next week and next month and...you get it.Our actions matter. We know the lack of instant gratification is hard.It's not like you put your mask on & suddenly our active cases drop by 12. This is the marshmallow test en masse.It's about knowing our actions now will pay dividends later.And with the new variants we don't have a choice but to be as vigilant as we can every day. These variants are new but the ways to keep them at bay are not. We know how to do this we just need to commit to it.If you like or share this do it because you're committing. Make it a sign. Your way of saying to your followers that you're on board.And you won't be alone.Occasional slip-ups aside the overwhelming majority of this community continues to follow the guidelines every single day & has been since the beginning. Our numbers confirm that.What we need to do now is commit to seeing this through to the end.We know this is a lot.You've likely had a busy day today.You‚Äôd probably like to lay down in sheets of linen.But Tony Danza can't hold you closer right now.If we all commit to doing our part though he'll be able to someday soon...once you‚Äôre both vaccinated of course.-OPH out.",4,ottawahealth

3678211255548800,2021-01-28 12:27:50,"üé∂SCHOOOLLLS OUT -- NOT SO FAST ALICE COOPER!So schools are opening. Is this a good thing or a risky thing? Short answer: Yes.Long answer: read this ridiculously long post (sorry)Schools aren't opening because ""things are great"". Literally nothing about this is cause to relax.It‚Äôs quite the opposite actually. Simply put: schools are opening because the risks and impacts of keeping schools closed far outweigh those of opening them.Remember: just as peace is more than the absence of war good public health is more than the absence of disease.Make no mistake: there is no such thing as a risk-free activity. We once sprained a finger whilst typing a tweet (true story).But like we've said before public health is about harm reduction. It's a pillar of our work. Our role is to help you identify and balance risks.Are there risks in opening schools? Yes. But it's about reducing harms. Schools aren't risk-free but they're a better option for kids than a playdate at home.There's also harms with keeping schools closed. Be it families whose routines are in chaos parents trying to help children with online learning while working from home people supporting coworkers who need to take time off children missing out on much-needed social interaction homes that may not offer a safe space or the incredible teachers who have worked tirelessly to educate our children remotely...many members of our community are far from ok right now.And getting our children back into school is a necessary step towards easing the strain as we continue our community's journey through this pandemic.Will this one step solve all our community's mental health needs? No but it‚Äôs progress. And it‚Äôs needed.The timing of posting this thread on Bell Let's Talk day is not lost on us. And yes we just shamelessly used this post to promote Bell Let's Talk day. Twice.But and this is a massive BUT...absolutely nothing about this should make you think we are anywhere near being in the clear and that we can open everything back up.We are NOT saying that we need to ease any of the other restrictions currently in place under the Provincial stay-at-home order. Why? Because we need them. Now more than ever. This is the time to be more vigilant than we've ever been before. It‚Äôs still #StayHome just now with schools opening.Our children need this. This is THEIR essential work. Parents need this. Teachers need this. And we owe it to everyone to make sure schools stay open. We need to do this for our kids together.Now as with all things there are risks we can control and risks we cannot. We'd be remiss if we didn't acknowledge those of you who are asking about paid sick days. Indeed that is something which would likely minimize risks but the decisions about that are out of our properly washed hands.But let's focus on the things we CAN do. We must continue being wise. Parents must screen their kids daily and keep them home (except to get tested) if they have ANY symptoms of COVID-19.It is vital that our kids only socialize w/those they live with outside of school and that adults also seek testing immediately if experiencing symptoms. The stakes are just too high to do it any other way.The only way this works is if we keep community transmission as low as possible. December & January showed us how quickly things can turn.But we were able to lower the level of COVID-19 in the community in the fall so we know it‚Äôs possible. We just need to do our part.For us we‚Äôre working to up our school health team‚Äôs capacity we‚Äôre coordinating w/testing partners to increase capacity to test kids & we're increasing communications to schools/families so that everyone is reminded of the best ways to limit transmission & support one another.We'll keep doing what works. We‚Äôll keep contact tracing. We'll keep answering your questions when you reach out. And yes we'll keep writing Facebook posts (sorry).Nothing lasts forever. Not shutdowns not COVID & not the Bernie memes or the Tiger King (thank goodness).-OPH out",4,ottawahealth

3440773825959212,2020-10-30 15:59:54,PIE CHARTS OUTBREAKS & FRUSTRATION: yet another very long post.Yesterday the province presented data about sources of COVID-19 outbreaks in Ottawa. That data notably the pie charts caused some confusion and we completely understand your frustrations.Perhaps we can clear things up a smidgen?In a pandemic it's even more vital that you get clear concise info to help you understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the guidance that is being provided. Many of you are currently frustrated and please know that we understand. Sometimes the data can be overwhelming and we'd like to help.Important note: outbreaks are part of the picture but not all. Of our nearly 7000 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date (the real number is much higher as not everyone gets tested) just over 2150 came from confirmed outbreaks (a little over 30%).But what are outbreaks?An outbreak is declared when our investigation work identifies links between cases within a specific setting and each setting has different criteria. Hospitals require 2 cases to declare an outbreak. For LTC homes due to the higher risk to the residents only 1 case is needed to declare an outbreak. Schools/childcare require 2 cases & class lists help our contact tracing work making it easier to identify cases/transmission. Community outbreaks (bars/restaurants gyms etc.) require 2 cases & the data usually relies on clients recalling their exposure times & contacts.Basically the parameters for declaring outbreaks are different & some are easier to define and identify.So now back to yesterday's provincial data: it showed that 2% of outbreaks came from restaurants/bars & 5% from gyms. Yes a relatively low %.Now kindly consider this percentage: of cases among 20-49 yr-olds (non-healthcare workers & no household contact) 92% of them did NOT come from an outbreak. Yes...ninety-two percent. Just because an outbreak was not declared in a specific setting does not mean transmission did not occur there.The simple fact is: looking at outbreaks alone is not an accurate way to portray what we know about the situation in our community. Here's what we do know: over the past few weeks newly reported cases per day are stabilizing as are school outbreaks & hospitalizations.We've seen the first evidence of decrease in the rise of cases of 20-29 yr-olds (very encouraging!). We're seeing what we've seen before: our actions matter. This month was hard but we're almost there. If we can keep this up November is lining up to be a much better month for our community.Very soon when many businesses start reopening/resuming operations it's up to all of us to continue doing the right things to limit the spread & importantly to increasingly support our local businesses...they need our patronage more than ever. So please support local & do so kindly & COVID-wisely.It's been a year Ottawa. We've learned a lot and we're learning more each day. We'll keep doing our best to get our community through this.We can't hold your hands but please wash them anyway!-OPH out.,4,ottawahealth

Governments must recognise the long-term effects of the virus and ensure access to health services for those patients.Their stories reinforce how morally unconscionable and unfeasible the so called ‘natural herd immunity’ strategy is. Not only would it lead to millions more unnecessary deaths it would also lead to a significant number of people facing a long road to full recovery.Herd immunity is only possible with safe and effective vaccines that are distributed equitably around the world.
